## Executive summary


This report represents the results of the engagement with **{{client_name}}** to review **{{project_name}}**.

The review is part of a broader engagement with HaloDAO that also includes the [HaloDAO AMM](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-halo-dao-setcaps-amm-2021-10) component.

The full review was conducted over the course of **{{review_period}}** from **{{date_interval}}**. We spent a total of **{{person_days}} person-days** reviewing the code.


## Scope

The initial review focused on the [{{project_name}}]({{source_repository}}) repository, identified by the commit hash `{{commit_hash}}`.

We focused on manually reviewing the codebase, searching for security issues such as, but not limited to, re-entrancy problems, transaction ordering, block timestamp dependency, exception handling, call stack depth limitation, integer overflow/underflow, self-destructible contracts, unsecured balance, use of origin, costly gas patterns, architectural problems, code readability.

**Includes:**

- code/contracts/buyback/Treasury.sol
- code/contracts/buyback/interfaces/ICurve.sol
- code/contracts/buyback/interfaces/ICurveFactory.sol
- code/contracts/buyback/interfaces/IUniswapV2Router01.sol

- code/contracts/incentives/interfaces/IAToken.sol
- code/contracts/incentives/interfaces/IERC20.sol
- code/contracts/incentives/interfaces/IERC20Detailed.sol
- code/contracts/incentives/interfaces/IRnbwDistributionManager.sol
- code/contracts/incentives/interfaces/IRnbwIncentivesController.sol
- code/contracts/incentives/interfaces/IStakedAave.sol

- code/contracts/incentives/lib/ERC20.sol
- code/contracts/incentives/lib/SafeMath.sol
- code/contracts/protocol/tokenization/IncentivizedERC20.sol


## Recommendations

We identified a few possible general improvements that are not security issues during the review, which will bring value to the developers and the community reviewing and using the product.

### Increase the number of tests

A good rule of thumb is to have 100% test coverage. This does not guarantee the lack of security problems, but it means that the desired functionality behaves as intended. The negative tests also bring a lot of value because not allowing some actions to happen is also part of the desired behavior.

## Artifacts

### Surya

SÅ«rya is a utility tool for smart contract systems. It provides a number of visual outputs and information about the structure of smart contracts. It also supports querying the function call graph in multiple ways to aid in the manual inspection and control flow analysis of contracts.
